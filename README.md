 Task 4: Car Prices Data Visualization 

Objective:

     To analyze and visualize key patterns in car pricing using Power BI, including relationships between features like transmission type, year, mileage, and price.

Dataset Used:
 
    File Name:car_prices.csv
    Fields Used: make, transmission, year, odometer, sellingprice, etc.
    Description: Contains details about used cars including selling prices, mileage, brand, year, and other features.

Tools Used:

    Microsoft Power BI Desktop
    
Charts Created:

   Bar Chart – Average Selling Price by Transmission
   
       X-Axis: transmission
       Y-Axis: Average of sellingprice
       Insight: Automatic cars have a higher average selling price compared to manual.

   Column Chart – Count of Cars by Transmission
   
       X-Axis: transmission
       Y-Axis: Count of cars (VIN/ID)
       Insight: More automatic cars are available in the dataset, showing higher popularity.

   Scatter Plot – Odometer vs Selling Price
   
       X-Axis: odometer
       Y-Axis: sellingprice
       Insight:Higher mileage cars tend to have lower selling prices, indicating typical depreciation.

   Line Chart – Average Selling Price by Year
   
       X-Axis: year
       Y-Axis: Average of sellingprice
       Insight: Newer cars (recent years) have significantly higher average prices.

 Summary:
 
        The dashboard provides a clear visual understanding of how transmission type, mileage, and manufacturing year influence the car's selling price. This helps in identifying market trends and customer preferences in used car sales.
